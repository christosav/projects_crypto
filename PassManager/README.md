# PassManager
In this project i developed a Java application for secure password managment. I used AES (128 bits key) for symmetric encryption, RSA (2048 bits keypair) for assymetric encryotion and SHA-1 as hash function. App acts as Certificate Authority that creates X.509 certificates for the users after the submittion of a certification request uppon registration.
