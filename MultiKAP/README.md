# MultiKAP
In this project we implemented 3 Key Agreement Protocols:

* **Encapsulation**: One initiator creates a symmetric key and encrypts it with the public key of the other part (peer). Next, it sends the encrypted key to the peer. The latter removes the symmetric key using its private key. 
* **Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocol**: Two users end up in a shared secret key by exchanging messages at first to an unsafe channel. DH offers the ability to set up a secret key between two users. 
* **Station-to-Station Protocol (StS)**: Based on DH but offers mutual authentication using certificates.
