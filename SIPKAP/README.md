# SIPKAP
In this project, we dealt with the use of the key agreement protocol Station-to-Station to ensure the confidentiality of SIP messages between four (or more) entities (Bob, ProxyA , ProxyB, Alice). The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol is used to establish, modify, and terminate a VoIP communication. SIP is based on a client-server model, text-based, and resembles the HTTP and mail transport (SMTP) protocols. SIP essentially implements a set of steps that aim to transform client-server communication between the two users into peer-to-peer. After consolidating peer-to-peer communication, the RTP protocol, which undertakes to transfer multimedia data, is addressed. In our implementation we have not implemented VoIP on its merits, but a secure system for exchanging messages based on the SIP protocol that does not use the RTP protocol for data transfer and management as our implementation data is not multimedia content.
