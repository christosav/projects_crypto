# RSA - ElGamal - Rabin
For the implementation of RSA, El Gamal and Rabin cryptographic algorithms , I mainly relied on the book "A handbook of applied cryptography "and in the GMP library" GNU MP Edition 6.0.0 "but and in a study I made on the internet. I tried not to exclude any of them procedures described in the book using the appropriate functions of the GMP library, and display detailed messages about what's happening at each step. The codes are written in C ++ 03.
